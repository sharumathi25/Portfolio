          <p>
            In this project, We are using our hand as a virtual mouse,
             that can do everything as a mouse does without 
             even touching your system and using the webcam of 
             my system to detect our hands.

          <h3>Flipkart Reviews</h3>
          <p>
            The present study is undertaken to understand the market potential and customer's satisfaction for an ecommerce
company's services with special reference to Flipkart in Delhi region. also found out the
various attributes of an e-commerce company and especially for Flipkart's services on the basis of which
consumer chooses an e-commerce company for shopping. I also tested the consumer's satisfaction level
towards Flipkart and also the availability of the Products at the Web Portal. Now a day's people go for a
brand, not for a product and therefore, this is the reason that the companies are looking for brand
building. From the customer point of view, there are some benefits of using a brand. The study is
conducted to find out the customer's satisfaction level in services of Flipkart in the market and to know
the availability of the products at the web Portal.
